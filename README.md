# Fairtrade Simulator

A web game to spread awareness about Fairtrade.

## Background

You live the life of a member in a small coffee farm. Your fellow farmers agree that you and your team are failing to compete with larger plantations and have difficulty improving your lifestyle and farm, since your scope of customers is limited to locals and few traders will buy your product at market price. What is going to happen to you?
